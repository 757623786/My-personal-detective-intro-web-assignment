      <h1 class="w3-center">the Green River Killer</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">From 1980-2000</h5>
      <p class="w3-large" style="text-align: justify;">Gary Ridgway is the most prolific serial killer in American history.
        He was dubbed the "Green River Killer" because the bodies of the first five victims were found near the Green River in the southern 
        suburbs of Seattle. The Green River Serial Murders were the most shocking case in the United States in the 1980s. 
        The killer was arrested in 2001, but he did not mention any of his crimes for two years. 
        He confessed to his crimes in 2003 in order to ask the court to change his death sentence to life imprisonment.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium" style="text-align: justify;">Gary attacked his first victim, a 6-year-old boy, 
        when he was 16, but the victim survived. As an adult, Gary worked as a truck painter, 
        which enabled him to use trucks of different license plates and models to commit crimes. Gary's targets were often prostitutes and 
        homeless young women, most of whom were under 20 years old. Gary would first rape the victims, then strangle them to death, 
        and then dump their bodies in the river. Gary's friends and family all agreed that he was friendly, but occasionally behaved strangely.
        Neighbors often heard him grappling with prostitutes. Gary divorced his wives twice because they did not believe in God. 
        He often participated in mysterious religious ceremonies and believed in cults.</p>
