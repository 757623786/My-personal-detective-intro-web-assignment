      <h1 class="w3-center">the Serial Murder Case in Baiyin City</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">From 1988-2002</h5>
      <p class="w3-large" style="text-align: justify;">
        The "Baiyin Serial Murder Case" refers to a case in which 11 women were brutally murdered in their homes in Baiyin City, 
        Gansu Province, China, from 1988 to 2002. Some of the victims had been sexually assaulted. 
        The murderer targeted young women, and his methods were cruel and extremely covert, causing great social panic. 
        In 2004, the Baiyin City police announced the details of the case to the outside world and offered a reward of 200,000 yuan in 
        the hope of obtaining clues.</p>
      <br><p class="w3-large" style="text-align: justify;">
        In March 2016, the Gansu Provincial Public Security Department restarted the investigation; 
        on August 26, the criminal police arrested the suspect in a small shop at the Baiyin Industrial School. 
        After preliminary interrogation, the suspect Gao Chengyong confessed to the crime of committing 11 rape and murder cases and 
        killing 11 people between May 1988 and February 2002. The "8.05" series of rape, murder and mutilation of women in Gansu and 
        Inner Mongolia was successfully solved. This is another case with a huge impact in the country that has been solved since the 
        Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security organized a crackdown on difficult and unsolved murder cases.</p>
      <br><p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium" style="text-align: justify;">On April 24, 2017, the People's Procuratorate of 
        Baiyin City, Gansu Province announced that the Baiyin City Procuratorate filed a public prosecution against the defendant 
        Gao Chengyong in accordance with the law. On July 17, the Baiyin City Intermediate People's Court opened a trial of the 
        Baiyin City serial murder case. Due to privacy issues, the case will be heard in private. At 11:15 am on July 18, 
        At the end of the trial, Gao Chengyong did not apologize to his family.</p>
      <br><p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium" style="text-align: justify;">At 10:00 on March 30, 2018, the Baiyin Intermediate 
        People's Court of Gansu Province pronounced the first-instance verdict, and the defendant Gao Chengyong was sentenced to death 
        for intentional homicide, rape, robbery, and insulting corpses. The court also ordered the defendant Gao Chengyong to compensate 
        the plaintiff in the incidental civil lawsuit for material losses. Gao Chengyong expressed his acceptance of the verdict in court 
        and did not appeal. On the morning of January 3, 2019, with the approval of the Supreme People's Court, the criminal Gao Chengyong 
        was executed. The procuratorate sent personnel to supervise on the spot in accordance with the law.</p>
